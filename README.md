# primecheck.py
A CLI tool to check if any ints in a list are prime and print their factors, or to print all primes up to *n*.

## Usage
Clone the repo, cd into the directory, and install with `pip install .`
The cli command for the program is `pprime` (mnemonic for 'py-prime').

### Prime-Check
Pass any number of ints as positional arguments and the program will print them back in color. All primes are green, all composites are red.

#### Unsorted
By default, the program sorts the list before it prints it back, but this can be overridden with the `-U` flag.

#### Grouped Factors

By default, the program will print out the sorted set of unique factors of any composite integer. When the `-G` flag is set, the factors will be grouped into their factor pairs.

#### Prime Factors

Setting the `-P` flag prints the prime factors of the integer rather than the composite factors.

### Prime-List
Pass the `-N` flag followed by an int to print all primes up to that number.

### Radical Simplification

Simplify any nth-root radical with `-rs {nth} {base}` by factoring out all perfect squares. The radical terms are formatted `root{nth}{base}`. For example, `3(root(3)(6))` is equivalent to `3 * âˆ›6`

## Testing Implementation
The program's `Test` class is intended to be used for testing with `pytest`. The two functions are checked against a [list of the first ten-thousand primes](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/10000.txt) as well as each other. To run the tests, clone the repo, cd into the directory, and run `pytest` in the terminal.
